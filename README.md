# VATSIM Germany Quicksheets

This repository contains quick reference sheets (quicksheets) for virtual controlling on the VATSIM network in Germany. The quichsheets are designed to help VATSIM members who are controlling virtual air traffic to quickly reference important information related to the airports listed below:

- EDDF (Frankfurt Airport)
- EDDL (DÃ¼sseldorf Airport)
- EDDK (Cologne/Bonn Airport)
- EDDS (Stuttgart Airport)

not anymore supported:
- ~~EDDB (Berlin Brandenburg Airport)~~
- ~~EDDC (Dresden Airport)~~

Please note that EDDT (Berlin Tegel Airport) is currently closed due to its aerodrome being inactive and the D-CTR being dissolved.
These quicksheets are intended to be used in conjunction with other resources and tools, such as VATSIM's official documentation and software.
